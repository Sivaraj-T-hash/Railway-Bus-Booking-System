# Railway/Bus Reservation System 🚉🚌

A console-based ticket management system developed in **C** to automate the process of booking and canceling transport tickets. This project demonstrates the practical application of fundamental data structures and dynamic memory management.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Automated Seat Allocation**: Automatically assigns the next available seat to passengers, preventing double-booking.
* **Real-Time Availability**: Instantly view the status of all 20 seats to check which are booked and which are free.
* **Flexible Cancellation**: Allows users to cancel tickets using either their **Seat Number** or **Passenger Name**.
* **Passenger Management**: Systematic storage of passenger details including name and age for easy retrieval.
* **Memory Efficiency**: Uses **Dynamic Memory Allocation** (`malloc` and `free`) to manage passenger records only while they are active.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Language**: C
* **Data Structures**: 
    * **Arrays**: Used for fixed seat tracking.
    * **Singly Linked Lists**: Used for dynamic passenger record storage.
* **Development Environment**: Dev-C++
* **Operating System**: Windows 11



## 📂 Project Structure
